## Contents:
- `EDA_Optimising_NYC_Taxis_Sitoshna_Bhoi.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and visualizations
- `Report_Optimising NYC Taxi Operations_Sitoshna_Bhoi.pdf`: Final report summarizing insights, plots, and recommendations
- NYC Taxi Zone shapefiles and dataset (loaded via Google Colab or local paths)

## Summary:
This project explores NYC taxi trip data to uncover patterns in:
- Trip frequency across time and geography
- Passenger count trends by zone
- Routing inefficiencies
- Strategic zone-level cab positioning
- Demand-based dispatching and pricing suggestions

## Tasks Completed:
- [x] Data Loading and Cleaning
- [x] Trip Volume by Time and Zone
- [x] Mapping with GeoDataFrames
- [x] Insights and Recommendations
- [x] PDF Report Generation

## Assumptions:
- Data is complete and clean from source
- Zones with no trips assumed to have zero demand
- Used provided NYC Taxi Zones shapefile for geospatial plotting
